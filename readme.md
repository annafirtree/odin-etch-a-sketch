This is Anna Macdonald's take on the Odin Project's [Etch-a-Sketch](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project) assignment.

Use my [Etch-a-Sketch here](http://annafirtree.github.io/odin-etch-a-sketch).

Although my assignment generally follows the guidelines given by the Odin Project, in the place of their optional random-color-generator, I instead put in buttons to let the user choose a color, since I thought that would be more useful.
